## Guidelines for AI Assistants

- Read this file at the start of every session to understand current project state.
- Keep this file updated as the project evolves -- add new commands, conventions, and architecture notes when introducing them.
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones.
- Do not over-engineer; keep changes minimal and focused on the task at hand.
- When adding new tooling (linters, test frameworks, build tools), document the relevant commands and configuration in this file.
- Follow any code style and conventions established in linter/formatter configs once they exist.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
